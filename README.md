# TweetBlog

  - Built a Java Enterprise Web Application that allows users to maintain the group blog. 
  - It contains a public “front page” showing the recent blog in reverse chronological order, along with the author of each post and the date it was posted. 
  - Users can even create an account providing username and password, so as to allowing that user, to create a new blog, if logged in. 
  - Used the “Model 2” MVC architecture combining the Servlets, JSPs and Maven dependencies. Used sessions to maintain the state and Hashmap to store the users post, and users profile information.
